# EEGLab_Preprocess
The eeglab is used to preprocess and visualize the eeg dataset. Although the interface is handable for people, it veils the underlying codes. This respo achieves the common-use functions in the form of codes (of course, base EEGlAB)
Note: you need to install eeglab under matlab (including the iclabel plugin)
